This is the code repository for [Going Serverless with .NET [Video]](https://prod.packtpub.com/in/application-development/going-serverless-net-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.


 


## About the Video Course

Serverless architecture allows you to build and run applications and services without having to manage the infrastructure. Many companies have started adopting serverless architecture for their applications to save money and improve scalability. 

This video will be your companion as you design serverless architectures for your applications with Microsoft Azure as the cloud service provider and using the .NET Core runtime. You will begin by understanding about serverless architecture, its advantages and disadvantages. You will then set up the Azure environment and test a simple serverless function using AWS platform. From here you will learn to build a real multi-tier, a serverless application with C# as the scripting language. 

You will also learn to build, test and deploy the Middle tier application along with Data and Presentation tiers. Finally, we will look at testing, securing and authenticating your serverless application. 
By the end of the course, you will be equipped with the knowledge to build scalable and cost-efficient .NET applications with serverless architectures.
